Hello, Thank you for clicking on this page. My name is Kapil Sathyakumar and I am currently a senior
at NJIT studying Business and Information Systems. I am interested in Real Estate and looking to advance my skills in technology. My work has taught me responsibility, and management. I have a lot of
work experience in the staffing industry but I am currently improving my tech experience but I do my best to learn as much as possible and to one day get
a better job at a reputable company to expand and use my knowledge in computers. I hope to one day work for myself and operate my own business
and continue my career from there.
